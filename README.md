6. Demonstrate ability to build and execute functional test cases for an application.
 
## Preparing for Assignment 1 
In Assignment 1, you will be introduced to the python programming language and to Django, a Model View Template framework we will be using to develop web applications. All information concerning set-up and preparing for this assignment can be found in the beginning of the [Python Blog Tutorial](django2_by_example_blog_tutorial.md). Once you have completed the Blog Tutorial and deployed your code to GitHib and your blog application to Heroku or Pythonanywhere, follow the directions below.

## Deliverables for Assignment 1 - Part 1:
1. When you are happy with your working code push the code to GitHub and be sure your GitHub repository is updated.
2. Create a markdown file/document and make a few screenshots of your unit test environment running on your laptop with screenshots of the Blog and the admin section of the application. The URL should be easily visible in the screenshots showing localhost `127.0.0.1`. Add it to the markdown file/document labeled 4900_Assignment1.
3. Add to the markup file/document a link to your blog running in Heroku or Python Anywhere. Along with a few screenshots of it running there as well.
4. Create additional superusers in the application deployed to Heroku or PythonAnywhere with the following credentials so I can login and use all features of the application:
```script
ID: instructor
Email: groyce@unomaha.edu
Password: instructor1a

ID: instructor
Email: spawaskar@unomaha.edu
Password: instructor1a
```
5. Be sure to include links to your Heroku or Pythonanywhere Blog site and Github site in the markdown file by the deadline.
